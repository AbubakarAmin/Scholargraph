"""
OpenReview client: fetches submissions + their Official_Review replies for a
venue, and extracts reviewer-stated weaknesses as pre-formalized research gap
signals — literal expert-identified limitations, not LLM-inferred ones.


Auth is required (OpenReview API v2 needs a session even for public reads at
reasonable rate). Uses api2.openreview.net (v2) — v1 (api.openreview.net) is
legacy and many current venues (ICLR 2025+, NeurIPS 2024+) are v2-only.
